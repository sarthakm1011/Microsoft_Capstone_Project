## DAT102x: Predicting Heart Disease Mortality 
HOSTED BY MICROSOFT

This project gives you an opportunity to put into practice all of the skills you have learned by completing the courses in 
the Microsoft Professional Program for Data Science.It is the culmination of your journey towards becoming a data scientist.

Your goal is to predict the rate of heart disease (per 100,000 individuals) across the United States at the county-level 
from other socioeconomic indicators. The data is compiled from a wide range of sources and made publicly available by 
the United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service (USDA ERS).

Target Variable: We're trying to predict the variable heart_disease_mortality_per_100k (a positive integer) 
for each row of the test data set.
